# Project Reflection

## 1. Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation. Is it what you expected?

Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.

## 2. Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

Student discusses how they chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). This could be have been done through manual tuning, twiddle, SGD, or something else, or a combination!
